# Quick Start: Add Product Images

## Fastest Way to Get Started

1. **Open `create-images.html`** in your web browser
2. **Click "Generate & Download All 16 Images"** button
3. **Wait for all images to download** (they'll download automatically)
4. **Move all downloaded images** to this `images` folder
5. **Done!** Your website will now display the images

## What You'll Get

The generator creates 16 placeholder images:
- `product-1.jpg` through `product-16.jpg`
- Each image shows the product ID, name (English & Arabic), and category
- Color-coded by product type
- Ready to use immediately

## After Downloading

1. Check your browser's Downloads folder
2. Find all 16 files: `product-1.jpg`, `product-2.jpg`, etc.
3. Copy them to: `[your project folder]/images/`
4. Refresh your website - images will appear!

## Replace with Real Photos Later

When you have actual product photos:
1. Take photos of each product
2. Name them: `product-1.jpg`, `product-2.jpg`, etc.
3. Replace the placeholder images in the `images` folder
4. That's it! No code changes needed.
